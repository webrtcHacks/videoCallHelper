# ðŸŸ¢ Presence Applet
Detects if the camera and/or microphone is being used (via trackData).  The presence of a camera and/or microphone stream is considered "on". 
Displays the number of camera and microphone streams. 
Can be configured to send a webhook to a specified URL when presence is "on" or "off".
I use this to display a busy light outside my office to let visitors know when I am on calls.

## Storage

```javascript
presence = {
  on: {
    onUrl: "",
    onMethod: "POST",
    onPostBody: "",
    onHeaders: "",
  },
  off: {
    offUrl: "",
    offMethod: "POST",
    offPostBody: "",
    offHeaders: "",
  },
  hid: false,
  active: false,
  enabled: false
}
```
